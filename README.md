# Alf's All spiders here!
------------
After learning the spider program in python, I just have a little try with drawbacks. <br>
twt_spider1.py is used to draw my school news, but it can only get the side-news. <br>
Maybe the class went wrong<br>
The other two .py files are tests and examples I found online. <br>
Since I do not want a lot of repositories named after xxx spider, <br>
All the test&learn .py files will be put here <br>
Hope to develop a master skill of net crawler! <br>
