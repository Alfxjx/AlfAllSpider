# spider-the-TWT-News
------------
After learning the spider program in python, I just have a little try with drawbacks. <br>
twt_spider1.py is used to draw my school news, but it can only get the side-news. <br>
Maybe the class went wrong<br>
The other two .py files are tests and examples I found online.
